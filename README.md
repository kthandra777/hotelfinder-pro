- `ui.py`: Streamlit user interface
- `agents.py`: AI agent definitions and Streamlit UI setup
- `hotel_search.py`: Core search functionality across multiple providers
- `kayak.py`: Kayak-specific functionality
- `browserbase.py`: Interface with BrowserBase API for web scraping
- `groq_helper.py`: Groq LLM integration for AI summaries
